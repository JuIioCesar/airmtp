# airnef -- Wireless download from your Nikon Camera

Please look at the official homepage under http://www.testcams.com/airnef/ for more information.

This is the inofficial code repository of Airnef, an open-source utility for downloading images and movies from your WiFi-equipped Nikon camera. Airnef runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It supports all Nikon cameras that have built-in WiFi interfaces, along with those using external Nikon WU-1a and WU-1b WiFi adapters. Airnef may also work with Nikon's WT-4A and WT-5A wireless adapters for the D3/D4/D8x, although I don't have any of these adapters on hand to test. Airnef supports Canon and Sony cameras as well, although Canon supplies its own EOS Utility for wireless downloads. Airnef is licensed under GPL v3.
